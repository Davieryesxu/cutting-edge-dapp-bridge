# Cutting Edge DApp Bridge

A decentralized transaction escrow and bridging infrastructure for cross-platform blockchain interactions, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

Cutting Edge DApp Bridge is a sophisticated blockchain middleware that enables secure, trustless transactions across different platforms and applications. By providing a robust escrow mechanism and transaction management system, it solves critical interoperability challenges in the decentralized ecosystem.

## Core Features

- **Cross-Platform Transaction Escrow**: Secure fund management for multi-party interactions
- **Dynamic Fee Mechanisms**: Transparent and configurable platform fee structures
- **Flexible Transaction Types**: Support for various transaction models and use cases
- **Programmatic Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms for transaction verification and conflict mitigation

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform is built around a core transaction escrow contract designed for maximum flexibility:

### Bridge Transaction Escrow (`bridge-transaction-escrow`)
- Manages complex multi-party transactions
- Implements secure fund holding and release mechanisms
- Supports dynamic fee calculations
- Provides transparent dispute resolution pathways
- Enables cross-platform transaction validation

## Key Functions

### Sessions
```clarity
;; Create a new coding session
(create-session (provider principal) (amount uint))

;; Join an existing session
(join-session (session-id uint))

;; Confirm session completion
(confirm-session-completion (session-id uint))
```

### Reviews
```clarity
;; Submit code for review
(submit-code (repo-url (string-utf8 256)) (commit-hash (string-utf8 64)))

;; Create a review request with bounty
(create-review-request (reviewer principal) (bounty uint))

;; Complete a review
(complete-review (review-id uint))
```

### Reputation
```clarity
;; Register a new user
(register-user)

;; Add or update a skill
(add-skill (skill-name (string-ascii 64)) (category uint))

;; Endorse a user's skill
(endorse-skill (endorsed-user principal) (skill-name (string-ascii 64)))
```

### Payments
```clarity
;; Send a tip to a developer
(send-tip (recipient principal) (amount uint))

;; Create a session with payment in escrow
(create-session (provider principal) (amount uint))

;; Create a review request with bounty
(create-review-request (reviewer principal) (bounty uint))
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for Clarity development
3. Deploy the contracts to the Stacks blockchain
4. Interact with the contracts using the provided functions

## Security Considerations

- All monetary transactions use secure escrow mechanisms
- Dispute resolution systems are built into session management
- Rating and feedback systems have validation checks
- Platform fees are transparently handled
- Admin functions are properly access-controlled
